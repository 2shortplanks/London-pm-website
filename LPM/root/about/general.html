	<h2>Another FAQ?</h2><div class="item">
        <p>This is the FAQ for things not directly related to London.pm</p>
	</div>

    <h2>Where should I buy computer bits from</h2><div class="item">
        <p><a href="http://www.scan.co.uk/">www.scan.co.uk</a> and <a href="http://www.dabs.com/">www.dabs.com</a> both seem to be good online
        people although some would contend that haggling your way up
        Tottenham Court Rd will get things cheaper. YMMV</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Who should I host my website with?</h2><div class="item">
        <p><a href="http://www.blackcatnetworks.co.uk/">Blackcat networks</a>, <a href="http://www.mailbox.net.uk/">Mailbox</a> and <a http="http://www.nildram.net/">Nildram</a> all have good reputations with London.pm members</p>
    </div>

	<h2>What templating system should I use?</h2><div class="item">
<p>You have many choices here (As always in Perl, There's More Than One
Way To Do It, and it's often a case of picking the best fit for the job.)
Many of the group believe that <a href="www.template-toolkit.org">Template
Toolkit</a> is a good option, a view fostered by the fact (amongst other
reasons) that Andy Wardley (the author) has come and given us good talks
and convinced many of us.  And bought beer.  Beer helped.  Other members
of the group however remain unconvinced and nominate one of the other
alternatives out there as their template system of choice..
</p>
<p> The alternatives range from low level 'I just write custom perl each
time', though to using perl embedding languages, right up to using Matt
Sergeant's excellent <a href="www.axkit.org">AxKit</a>, a XML Application
Server (which Matt also gave us a talk on.)  At last count there where 33
different templating systems for perl (though this figure cannot possibly
not have changed by the time you're reading this.)  Note that these aren't
all incompatible systems, and we've had several examples of people using
pure Perl and Template Toolkit, Template Toolkit and AxKit, and other
crazy schemes.  Some London Perl Mongers even admit to liking PHP and
Python for templating systems (but not real programming ;-) .)
</p>
<p>
This discussion has been done to death on the list and no-one has ever
reached a consensus apart from maybe like many of these problems there is
no <em>one</em> best fit.  You want to plug your own template system of
choice and get it mentioned here?  Give us a talk at one of the technical
meetings.

            spring.com and Harvey Nash have all been mentioned in a
            positive light on the list.
