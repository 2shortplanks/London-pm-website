Network Troubleshooting Tools (the Basilisk book) is a book that has no
clear brief. In theory it is an introduction to data-gathering tools for
use when networking problems occur; in practice, it also deals with
general network device management, monitoring, and diagnostic
procedures. It tends to the superficial at times, in an attempt to
include at least a mention of all this material, but manages to serve as
a useful general introduction to network troubleshooting.
</p><p>

The book is openly biased towards Unix-based tools; however, there is a
section at the end of each chapter introducing, and briefly explaining,
Windows-based tools for those required to use them. Although it is clear
that the examples are written with FreeBSD in mind, they are
sufficiently generic that there is no difficulty in using them with
Linux or Solaris.
</p><p>

The chapters are arranged in a step-by-step fashion, starting with
connectivity: checking the local host configuration, basic
point-to-point testing, and path testing. Next is packet capture and
device discovery, ranging from passive listening to active
port-scanning. At this point the book abandons its troubleshooting theme
to include a fairly thorough treatment of SNMP; while this might be
useful to some readers, it has the feel of filler material, having
little to do with the book's primary purpose, except insofar as it lays
groundwork for the next chapter's discussion of gathering of RMON data
(as well as use of mrtg and ntop) for performance monitoring and
location of network bottlenecks.
</p><p>

After this, the book returns to its main theme, with connectivity
protocol testers (custom packet injectors, netcat, and load generators).
There follows an overview of application-level tools, which consists
largely of an explanation of how to telnet to ports 25, 80 and 110,
followed by some notes on DNS testing, route checking and NFS.
</p><p>

The next chapter is a miscellany: capturing command sessions, remote
logging by means of syslog, tcpwrappers, NTP and Tripwire. Finally, as a
counterpart to the first chapter's generic troubleshooting instructions,
is a section of specific instructions for troubleshooting firewalls,
measuring performance, finding bottlenecks, and other such tasks.
</p><p>

The book is aimed at a fairly new network administrator; it serves as a
light-weight introductin to networking (though it is pleasing to note
that the traditional "this is how a netmask works" explanation has not
been repeated here) and system administration, particularly in the early
chapters. It is an excellent match to the skills required for network
operations jobs, and is highly recommended for anyone starting in that
role.
</p><p>

More experienced administrators may still find something of use in this
book; while it does not by any means cover advanced concepts, its
overview of programs may well include utilities new to the reader. There
are some surprising omissions - mtr, for example, is significantly more
powerful and easy to use than the path-timing utilities described here -
but these are comparatively few.
</p><p>

The over-emphasis on SNMP is disappointing. While SNMP may well be
suitable for use across an internal network, the inherent insecurity and
difficulty of tunnelling a UDP-based protocol is not sufficiently
emphasised. No attention is paid to alternative means of collecting
current-function data - to network monitoring and alerting packages in
general - although this could certainly have been considered within the
book's ambit and would have added considerably to its value.
</p><p>

An omission of rather more concern is detail of the types of information
one can usefully gain from interrogating dedicated routers; while the
SNMP section describes one way of doing this, there is no discussion of
how else one might obtain a routeing table from (e.g.) a Cisco or
NetGear router, what other data are available, or what diagnostic
procedures might be of use.
</p><p>

There is more general Unix administration information here than would be
expected from a book focussed on network troubleshooting: use of ps and
netstat, for example, should surely be familiar to an administrator
before he is given responsibility for anything outside his own machine.
</p><p>
Overall, this is a useful book for the beginner and early intermediate
network administrator, with strong emphasis on Unix both as a diagnostic
platform and as the major component of the network.
