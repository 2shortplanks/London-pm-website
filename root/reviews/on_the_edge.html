<p>Brian Bagnall's history of two decades of Commodore teeters on the edge 
of being a good book, much as its subject teetered on the edge of               
success, but the assemblage of interviews and magazine excerpts is as           
messy as its subject.  On the edge: the spectacular rise and fall of            
Commodore does deliver on its promise of two decades of Commodore history       
as told by engineers and managers, but the best voices with no exception        
are the voices of the engineers.  Bagnall mostly lets the engineers speak       
for themselves and tell the history of their major projects, from the           
6502 and Pet development, through the heyday of the C64, to the evolution       
of the Amiga, down to the final disintegration of the company.</p>                  

<p>The book is part obituary and part tribute, beginning with the quote "Do
you remember? I do" from the musical group Bouncing Souls and ending Byte       
Magazine's August, 1994 obituary of the company and a "Where are they           
now?" section about the major characters mentioned in the book.  Between        
these sections, Bagnall charts the course of the company in segments            
between one and four years per chapter.  At times, he revisits the events       
of a given in year in separate chapters and refers backwards and forwards       
in time.</p>                                                                        

<p>This chronological approach does not work well for Bagnall.  He sometimes                                                                      
makes declarations that contradict earlier events and his constant              
jumping can make for tedious and muddled reading.  In a chapter covering        
1981 to 1983, we hear that after the departure of Commodore's lead              
engineer, Chuck Peddle, ideas for a business computer are ignored by            
Tramiel.  In the following chapter (Eleven) that deals with 1981, we are        
told that once Peddle left Commodore Tramiel proposed a line of business        
computers.  That contradiction is not acknowledged or explained, nor does       
Bagnall explain contradicting statements at the beginning of Chapter            
Eleven.  Near the middle of the book, Bagnall begins to repeat quotes           
from his interviews, and it is apparent that either Bagnall or his editor       
had trouble digesting 44 hours of interviews and dozens of magazine             
articles.  At times, Bagnall disingenuously juxtaposes quotes from his          
interviews to assemble a pseudo-dialog, and the results are stilted and         
unpleasant.</p>                                                                     

<p>Despite some flaws in the book's construction, the book succeeds in     
telling the evolution of Commodore's major and minor systems and                
chronicling the internal battles fought over the development of each            
system.  Bagnall competently describes the chip design processes of the         
1970s, details the challenges faced by engineers who were ordered to            
produce working models on short notice before major trade shows, revives        
the aura of success surrounding Commodore in the 1980s, and does an             
excellent job illustrating the erratic course of the company.  The              
company's successes and brilliance shines through the recollection of           
engineers, and Bagnall details the low points in sections entitled "The         
Curse of Commodore."  Each curse is numbered as though a sequel to the          
previous curse, and like any sequel some curses indicate greater damage         
to the company.  It is telling that chapter 22 contains the last section        
listing a curse, because the following final two chapters are a                 
continuous series of missteps, anger, frustration and failure.  Bagnall         
would have been challenged to identify a single misstep during                  
Commodore's final six years.</p>                                                    

<p>The strength of the book is in the anecdotes told by the engineers, and 
their memories brought back happy personal memories of the machines.            
Anyone who propped open a PET to let it cool on a hot summer day, or who        
programmed their first complex code on a C64, or even who enjoyed               
tinkering with a 6502 processor may remember fondly those distant days          
spent trying to make the Peeks and Pokes bend to one's will.  Readers           
outside of North America may be disappointed by the light attention given       
Commodore's international business, but the focus on America derives from       
the location of the engineers who designed the machines.  The book              
suffers the lack of an index, which would make it easier to untangle            
Bagnall's rambling story, and the bibliography is respectable.  The book        
was worth the several-month wait between announcement and publication,          
and would be a fine book to read during the holidays when one has tired         
of food, family and all things non-technical.</p>
