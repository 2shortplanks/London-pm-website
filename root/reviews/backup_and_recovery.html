I contributed part of a chapter to this book, and so I got a free copy.
I was expecting to take it home, put it on the shelf, and never use it.
Today, less than 48 hours after getting the book in the post, I had to
use it.  The thoughtful comments and excellent description of how dump/
restore work prevented me from looking like a complete tit on a public
mailing list.  I therefore recommend this book.
</p>

<p>
More seriously, it does look jolly good, covering just about all the
backupish stuff that I've heard of and lots that I haven't.  But more
importantly, it devotes lots of space to <b>restoring</b> your backups -
complete with step-by-step instructions for "bare metal" recovery - and
talks about things to do when your backups are broken.
</p>

<p>
And it covers things that lots of admins don't like to think about, like
Exchange and MySQL (and other databases; judging from a quick skim of the
Oracle section I expect the coverage to be good).
</p>

<p>
Buy a copy of this book for your friendly local sysadmin.  He will love
you for ever.
