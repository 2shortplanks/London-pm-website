To be honest, the idea of programming entire apps in Javascript filled
me with fear. Deep, pit of stomach fear. Sure I'd known somebody who
written a RecDescent parser in it but they were mad. Javascript was for
rollovers and that's pretty much it. Anything else is evil and wrong.
</p><p>
Surprisingly then, this book starts off with some good reasons
write apps in the language that dare not speak its name.
</p><p>
The book is split into 11 chapters, 10 of which contain complete
applications ranging from a Client Side Search Engine to an
Interactive Slideshow, Ciphers, Context Sensitive Help and an
entire Shopping Cart.
</p><p>
Each chapter is set up the same way - first the application
features and the Javascript techniques, then the application
itself and a thorough explanation of what each part is doing and
then, finally, potential extensions and modifications (although
doing those is left as an exercise to the reader).
</p><p>
The book also guides you through some of other aspects and
tricks of Javascript programming such as code organisation,
dealing with multiple platforms, graceful degradation and and
such.
</p><p>
There are also three appendices - a Javascript reference, links
to various resources and thirdly, and slightly bizarrely, a
Perl/CGI overview (which isn't very good, to be honest).
</p><p>
As the title implies, this book is a Cookbook and not a reference
or a tutorial however the amount of initial knowledge needed isn't
great and I found it useful as a learning tool.
</p><p>
All in all, two thumbs up, good, clean family fun.
