        <h2>Damian Conway talks</h2><div class="item">
<p>
The (in)famous Damian Conway has gave us the honour of not just one, but
two <b>FREE</b> talks at the end of August 2002.  The talks were on Tuesday and Thursday
the 27th/29th August, and took place at the aptly named <a
href="http://www.ethicalsoc.org.uk/conway/hall.htm">Conway Hall</a> in Red
Lion Square, London.  The nearest tube station is Holborn, with Chancery
Lane and Russell Square also nearby.  There's transport information along
with a map on the Conway Hall's <a

Dr. Damian Conway:  Biography:
</p><p>
Damian Conway is known as the "Mad Scientist of Perl". He has a Ph.D. in
Computer Science and is currently a Senior Research Fellow in the <a
href="http://www.csse.monash.edu.au">School of Computer Science and Software
Engineering</a> at <a href="http://www.monash.edu.au">Monash University</a>,
Melbourne, Australia.
</p><p>
A popular speaker and trainer, he is also the author of several infamous <a
href="http://www.cpan.org/authors/id/DCONWAY">modules</a> including:
Parse::RecDescent (parsing without lexing), Lingua::EN::Inflect (English
transformations without a dictionary), Lingua::Romana::Perligata (Perl
programming without English), Class::Multimethods (polymorphism without
objects), Quantum::Superpositions (quantum computing without tears), and Coy
(error messages without karma). A three-time winner of the Perl Conference's
Larry Wall Award, Damian is now banned from future competition and instead
has the conference's Best Technical Paper named after him.He is a member of
the technical committee for the <a
href="http://conferences.oreilly.com/perl5/">Perl Conference</a>, the
convener of the annual Perl <a
href="http://history.perl.org/CHI/index.html">haiku contest</a>, a columnist
for <a href="http://www.tpj.com">The Perl Journal</a>, and author of the
book <a href="http://www.manning.com/Conway">Object Oriented Perl</a>.  
</p><p>
Damian is closely involved in the design of Perl 6, where his job is to
tempt Larry with <a href="http://www.yetanother.org/damian/Perl5+i/">evil
ideas</a> (such as 
<a
href="http://www.yetanother.org/damian/Perl5+i/disjunctives.html">properties</a>, 
<a href="http://www.yetanother.org/damian/Perl5+i/switch.html">switches</a>, 
<a
href="http://www.yetanother.org/damian/Perl5+i/higherorder.html">currying</a>, 
<a
href="http://www.yetanother.org/damian/Perl5+i/disjunctives.html">superpositions</a>) 
and to <a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/exegesis/">explain</a> Larry's 
<a href="http://dev.perl.org/perl6/apocalypse/">apocalyptic visions</a>.
</p><p>
He lists his technical interests as: programming language design, teaching
programming, object orientation, software engineering, natural language
generation, synthetic language generation, emergent systems, declarative
programming, morphing, human-computer interaction, geometric modelling, the
psychophysics of perception, nanoscale simulation, and parsing.
</p><p>
He lists his personal interests as: reading, fitness, cinema, and Total
World Domination.
</p><p>
In his spare time, he travels barefoot across the U.S. -- teaching, playing
his flute, having alopecic flashbacks, preaching pacifist philosophy, and
generally beating the tar out of bad guys with his deadly kung-fu skills.
