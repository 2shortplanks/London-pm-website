<p>I'm happiest when I'm bouncing between lots of different tasks - whether
they're all independent or part of a larger project. This is great in an
emergency or when I'm working in a small team with a decent workload but
not so good when it comes to simultaneously juggling small, quick turn
around requests with longer, concentration demanding projects. I need a
certain amount of time to pick up where I was - not just to ensure I
don't skip a step or make a mistake. <a
href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/timemgmt/">Time Management for
System Administrators</a> understands why many sysadmins suffer from
this and how to remedy (no pun intended) it and some related topics.</p>

<p>The book can be broken up in to three parts, the first, consisting of
chapters 1-3, introduces the why of time management, how interruptions play
merry hell with our workload and why we devise and stick to routines.</p>

<p>The second chunk of the book, chapters 4-8, explains "The Cycle System"
(the capital letters just feel right). This is the authors technique for
balancing and controlling your tasks, calendar, priorities and
progressing towards your life goals; the last of these is less hokey than
it sounds. These chapters were the most interesting part of the book for
me and include the topics I'm most likely to dip back in to as I integrate
sections of it with my own daily routines.</p>

<p>The closing chapters are a grab-bag of goodies, they cover stress and
email management - which may be closely related, eliminating time wasters
(unfortunately not a guide to 'removing' your less able co-workers) and the
benefits of documentation and automation. This selection of material was
the least interesting to me, not just because I'm familiar with the
subjects but because they felt a little bolted on. As an example, the
sections on using make and processing shell arguments in the automation
chapter go on too long in an otherwise technology agnostic book.</p>

<p>Although the title mentions System Administrators there is a lot of
useful information in here for other technical staff, developers and QA
workers should be able to take a lot away from the book. I found the
authors style to be easy going (although I'm not too keen on teaching
through repetition in books - if I'm not sure of something I'll reread
the paragraph) and the advice seems to make sense. I'm adopting some of
the techniques from the book and I'll have to see how they hold up in
the field. But that's my part of the deal.</p>

<p>Score: 7/10 - contains some useful techniques, pointers and explanations
on why our role has different requirements when it comes to longer term
project work and the daily tasks list.</p>
