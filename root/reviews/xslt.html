Like many reviews, this is going to be as much about me as it is about
the book. I own a web site (plug: http://www.deep-purple.com) with
vast amounts of content (5000+ pages) and have had a nagging feeling
that the content needed to be more structured. Plus it would be nice
to be able to deliver the content to multiple platforms relatively
easily.
</p><p>
With my consulting hat on, I had actually recommended XSLT on one
occasion where the site designers and coders were from different
companies and a very firm divide between code, content and
presentation were required.
</p><p>
So I was hoping to grok XSLT.
</p><p>
Coming to XML from a "knowing what it's all about but never actually
having had to do anything with it" viewpoint is was very nice to be
guided gently through the initial concepts. Then it starts to get
nasty, and where it loses me.
</p><p>
XML, I get. Having tight, defined data formats is a good thing. Being
able to transform that data for many different media is also a good
thing but the hoops you have to jump through to get any results at all
seem daunting. I shall stick to the Template Toolkit and wait on Matt
Sargeant to produce something pragmatic.
</p><p>
As an O'Reilly, this is as competent as they get. Even if there are
236 pages of the main book and 204 pages of Appendix.
</p><p>
Overall, this was too far removed from anything I know or want to do
to be of any use to me.
