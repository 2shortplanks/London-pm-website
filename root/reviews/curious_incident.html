<p>Not strictly a book on programming - yet still an interesting book
for programmers to read - "The Curious Incident of the Dog in the
Night-time" was simultaneously released as a kids book and an adult novel
a la the omnipresent Potter child. Unlike Ms Rowling however, Mr Haddon
can not only tell a good story but is well versed in the black arts of
plot pacing, exposition and that nasty tricky dialogue stuff. Always a
good start.</p>

<p>"The Curious Incident" tells the story from the viewpoint of 
Christopher, a high functioning autist (some reviews, presumably 
bolstered by press releases have specified it as Aspergers but there's 
little evidence to confirm that in the book). One day he find his next 
door neighbour's dog dead - killed with the garden fork still pinning it 
to the ground. The story follows Christopher's attempts to solve the 
mystery and, in the process, finding out rather more about his mother's 
death and the relationships of those around him.</p>

<p>What makes this book novel is the style in which is written in. Since
it is in the form of a pseudo diary of Christophers it attempts to
present the world through the eyes of someone with autism with all the
attendant confusion and illogicalities of the world thrown into sharp
relief. This is dealt with with a mix of sensitivity and humour - never
is the reader encouraged to pity Christopher. In fact, quite the
opposite - Christopher seems to pity many of those around him and indeed
I certainly found myself feeling for the father on many occasions.</p>

<p>So, why have I sent this review to a programmers mailing list? Well,
the relationship between autism spectrum disorders and programming has
long been a subject that has interested me - it has shown that there is
a vastly higher incidence of Asperger's Syndrome and Dyspraxia among
children in Silicon Valley (and thus presumably the offspring of
programmers) than else where in the world. Many of the traits in the
book are recognisbale, to a much lesser extent, in my programming
friends. In fact I was rather surprised to recognise some of my own
habits mirrored by Christopher.</p>

<p>To be honest I'm sort of shoe horning this book into a london.pm
review because, well, I think it's a bitching book and everyone should
read it. But also because, in all honesty, I think it will be of
interest to hackers because of the subject matter and the way it's
written. Although maybe I'm just projecting ;)</p>
